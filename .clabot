  "message": "Thank you for your contribution and **Welcome to our Open Source Community!**\n\nTo make sure your pull request is accepted successfully, we ask all our open source contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement; having reviewed our contributor list, we require a CLA for the following people : ({{usersWithoutCLA}}).\n\n The Perspective repository uses the CLA Bot to check PRs, in order to be added to the CLA Bot you must sign via EasyCLA. In order to sign a CLA with FINOS, [just submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/finos/open-developer-platform/edit/main/EASYCLA_CHANGEME.md) with a simple change to this file (adding an empty line, or some random text at the bottom); this will trigger the EasyCLA bot, which will post a comment to the Pull Request stating whether all PR contributors are covered by FINOS CLA; if not covered, the bot will post instructions on how to sign the CLA, you can choose to sign an individual or corporate CLA depending on your situation. Once you have successfully signed the FINOS CLA you must email help@finos.org. Please include your full name, email address, and links to relevant PRs. \n\nThanks once again for your contribution. Let us work with you to make the CLA process quick, easy and efficient so we can move forward with reviewing and accepting your pull request. Feel free to email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) for any questions.
  "messageMissingEmail": "Thank you for your contribution and **Welcome to our Open Source Community!**\n\nTo make sure your pull request is successful, we need all our contributors to be identifiable, but we couldn't parse the GitHub details of the following people : {{unidentifiedUsers}}\n\nLuckily, resolving the issue is straightforward and you can resolve it by following the instructions below.\n\n1. Check your git client is configured with a user email `git config --list | grep email`\n2. If the user email is missing, run the following command, substituting with your git commit email address `git config --global user.email email@example.com`\n3. Make sure your git commit email is configured on GitHub by [Setting your Commit Email Address](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)\n4. Then, amend the authors in your commit history by using `git commit --amend` to change your last commit.\n\nAlternatively, use the slightly more complex `git reset --soft` and `git rebase` to checkout your changes, rewrite the commit history locally and (force) push changes to the downstream branch.\n\nIf you have any issues with the steps above, please email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) so we can help you resolve before reviewing and accepting your pull request.\n\nThanks once again for the contribution and understanding.\n\n_cc_ **@finos-admin**"
